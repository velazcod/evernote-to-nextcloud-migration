    "These dumplings are especially great to prepare when you’ve got some older rolls or slices of white bread left over that you would like to use up.",
    "The buns are cut into chunks, soaked in warm milk, and mixed into a dough with some additional flour and eggs.Parsleyis typically added, butthymealso works quite nicely.",
    "The dumplings pair well with savory meat dishes, and green salads. They also make a nice addition to broths and soups, in place ofnoodlesor matzoh balls. I personally love them with a classicBavarian cabbage salad with warm bacon.",
    "Cut the dumplings into slices and fry them in a pan with some butter until crispy. Not only is this really tasty, it’s a simple save some time in the kitchen the next day.",
    "The only thing you should avoid is heating these up in your microwave. This tends to extract all the moisture, making the dumplings dry and flavorless.",
    "What will you serve these with, in an effort to use up some of your kitchen leftovers in a tasty and satisfying way? Let us know in the comments!",
    "Cut the buns into thin slices and place in a bowl. Pour the warm milk over the sliced buns and leave to soak.",
    "Saute the onions in a pan with the butter until golden brown. Set aside to cool for a moment.",
    "In a bowl, thoroughly knead the eggs, flour, salt, parsley, onions, and the soaked buns until combined thoroughly.",
    "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.",
    "Wet your hands (for a better grip) and form 8-10 dumplings of equal size. Carefully place them in the boiling water and simmer over low heat for about 15 minutes. You'll know they're ready when they float up to the surface on their own and gently rotate. They should feel firm when you remove them from the water.",
    "Slice the bread into small pieces and add them to a bowl. Pour milk on top of the buns and let them soak.",
    "Dice the onions and parsley (optional). Add butter to a skillet and let warm for a minute or two on medium low.",
    "Add the add onions and parsley and sauté until golden brown. Remove from pan and allow to cool.",
    "Add the parsley and onions to the bowl of bread and mix in the eggs, flour, and salt and knead until all of the ingredients are combined thoroughly.",
    "Add water and a dash or two of salt toa large stockpot. Wet your hands (for a better grip) and form 8-10 balls of the same size.",
    "Place them in the boiling water and simmer over low heat for about 15 minutes.",
    "You’ll know they’re ready when they float up to the surface on their own and gently rotate. They should feel firm when you remove them from the water.",
    "Whether you are using this toplan a menu for Oktoberfestor just for everyday fare, these dumplings are a perfect excuse to let your bread get too old!",

    "JordanAugust 28, 2016 at 1:26 PMOh my goodness my mouth is watering! I have not had these in years and had forgotten about them. You know, I would have never thought about using soft pretzels. I bet that gives it a very unique taste and can really spice it up if you’re not just not into white bread as it can be rather bland. I won’t even look at the nutrients! If I don’t know them I can enjoy it guilt free. My question is, would you use salted soft pretzels or unsalted as I know you can get both?ReplyNina-Kristin IsenseeSeptember 16, 2016 at 1:28 AMHi Jordan, thanks for enjyoing this recipe. Indeed, using soft pretzels provides a nice twist to the usual flavor. Well, I think if you use salted ones, you can leave out the other pinch that is used in the recipe. Here in Germany, lye pastry is usually generously sprinkled with salt, so I sometimes just scrape off some of itReply",
    "anorexorcistAugust 28, 2016 at 10:32 PMI haven’t heard from these ones before, it’s actually a really curious and delicious way to combine veggies and white bread. When it comes to me, I’m not the biggest fan of vegetables in general, so the fact that they are kind of mixed with the bread makes the whole process really easy.It actually looks like a really easy to make recipe, I’ll try this one out!Thanks for sharing.Reply",
    "CDecember 18, 2016 at 2:52 PMMy Grandmother makes these with pork and sauerkraut every New Years and they are tremendous. We call them “Clays”. This is the only place online I could find the recipe. Thank you so much.ReplyReddixieApril 3, 2017 at 12:15 AMMy family and I grew up with the saurkraut and porkchops too. We don’t use milk but made them with water, eggs, salt, pepper and flour. Fried the chops then add water and put in oven. Made gravy with the pork juices.ReplyMaralou WhelanNovember 13, 2018 at 9:09 AMMy mother made these with sauerkraut and pork chops too. She didn’t use milk but used water, eggs, salt, pepper and little flour. She made brown gravy with pork juices then we topped with ketchup. My sister and I loved them, but we’ve never made them. Brings back memories. ThanksReplyAllison SidhuNovember 14, 2018 at 9:57 AMSounds delicious, Maralou. Glad we could bring back that memory for you.ReplyTerri SmathersSeptember 7, 2019 at 1:38 PMMy Slovenian grandmother made these and served them with goulash. If I remember correctly, after boiling she would lightly brown them in a fry pan with butter. So good. 50+ years later and it’s still my brother’s and my requested birthday dinner.ReplyCelinaSeptember 5, 2021 at 2:15 PMThat’s SO Awesome! What an Amazing Memory!!????????Thanx for Sharing!!ReplyStephanieOctober 15, 2019 at 7:02 AMDo these freeze well?ReplyRick SiasJuly 23, 2021 at 7:48 PMMy mother made also. She passed at 54 and been trying to find the recipe. I’m extremely happy to find. She put dumplings around roast near the end of roasting and toss in juices and brown. I’m in Heaven now.ReplyAllison SidhuJuly 28, 2021 at 8:46 AMWe’re so glad, Rick! Thanks for sharing your story, and enjoy the dumplings.Reply",
    "Betty Margiasso,March 3, 2017 at 6:10 PMMy mom made these with a pork roast and we put gravy over them. Delicious. I never got my mom’s receipe but this sounds just like it! Can’t wait to make it!Reply",
    "DukieDecember 23, 2017 at 3:33 PMI’ve just made these – my first time ever making dumplings. They came out just like in the picture! I am English, but live in Germany, and up until now, have had to make do with eating these beauties in a restaurant. Now l can have them whenever l want! Thank you so much!ReplyJeanDecember 31, 2017 at 3:41 PMI’m always looking for bread dumpling recipes. The following has been passed down in my family for well over a hundred years:1 long loaf bread – preferably white3-4 cups milkFlour – maybe a cup – depends on the moisture in the bread1 or 2 eggs – beat well1 teaspoon nutmeg1/2 teaspoon salt1 tablespoon sugarGrease the kettle (mine has a bail handle and holds about eight cups of liquid) and set in a pan of water. Break up bread, as if for stuffing – allow to dry out overnight if possible. Mix with remaining ingredients- your hands work best! Dough will be rather sticky. Place in greased kettle, cover with foil or a plate. Place kettle in a pan of water and steam. Dumpling is ready when knife blade comes out clean. Turn out on plate, cut into wedges and serve warm with onion gravy and pork roast.I was always told my frugal German relatives saved their ends of bread and rolls to make this!Reply",
    "ShannonJanuary 15, 2018 at 8:45 PMThese were great! Fantastic texture and perfect to go with a brat. Didn’t add onions and instead of parsley, used dill–because that’s what I had on hand. Created a simple cream, butter, and dill sauce as well. ???????? Great Grandma would be proud.Reply",
    "BarbOctober 11, 2018 at 2:15 PMMy mother made these with a pork roast for my Birthday dinner every year. My lifelong childhood friend will be making them for my 77th Birthday next week. My mother made them even more delicious by putting them in a hot oven for a while before serving them which gave them a little crispness on the outside. Scrumptious!ReplyKarenMarch 20, 2022 at 7:44 PMMy grandmother was from Germany. She passed her recipe to my mom, and down to my sisters & I. Our version was a bit different using grated raw potatoes, grated raw onion, eggs, stale bread, salt & pepper. They were boiled and served with pork roast, gravy, red cabbage or iceberg salad with vinegar and oil dressing.ReplyMarianSeptember 10, 2022 at 3:31 PMCan you give me your recipe? [Personal information removed by editor]. My stepfather used to make them your way. He’s now gone – I would love that recipe please.Reply",
    "JeanneDecember 17, 2018 at 5:16 PMMy German grandmother made these with pork and sauerkraut. So good!! We called them dough balls! I’m thinking of trying to make them this New Years day which was the tradition for my grandmother.ReplyAllison SidhuDecember 20, 2018 at 10:33 AMSounds delicious, Jeanne! Enjoy the recipe, and happy holidays.Reply",
    "IreneApril 26, 2019 at 10:11 AMIf you manage to have any leftover for the next day…do as was suggested and fry them up in butter until crispy, but then toss on a couple of beaten eggs to scramble with the crispy knoedel – my mother indicated that this is what her father used to be able to purchase in Prague when he was in medical school in the 20’s at any gasthaus – a cheap student’s meal. I always make extra so that I can have this the next day!Reply",
    "Donna BrownMay 15, 2019 at 9:35 PMExactly the way my mom and grama made them! Served with a pork roast and gravy and sauerkraut. Thanks for sharing!Reply",
    "MimiOctober 17, 2019 at 10:43 PMI made this recipe with Gulasch and the kraut Salad. I did not turn out well but I think the rolls were too fluffy and ended up falling apart in the pot. I am good with traditional potato dumplings so I just took the mess and fried it with butter. I will give it another go.Reply",
    "Kathy HildenspergerNovember 23, 2020 at 9:08 PMMy dad always made this for us but he made it in soup form. Said it was an old German family recipe. We always called it breadball soup. This sounds delicious though! I have attached the link to dad’s recipe if you’re interested!https://www.netcooks.com/recipes/Soups/Bread.Ball.Soup.htmlReply",
    "CarolMarch 22, 2021 at 6:07 PMMy Grandfather was from Austria/Hungary. He and my Polish Grandmother made something they called kneadles (sp?) which were white bread balls with water, flour, egg and navy beans! We’d have them with my Grandmother’s sour browned flour mushroom soup. I loved them even better the next day, as you described, cubed and fried in butter until the outside was crispy. I have never seen a recipe anywhere to confirm that anyone else ever ate them too … until now! Thanks so much for the memories and another variation on a dish I grew up eating.Reply",
    "Norma WhiteMarch 22, 2022 at 9:02 AMGerman grandmother made very similar to these. But no eggs instead she finely shredded raw potato with hers. I do 5 small potato and 1 loaf bread and little flour. She boiled hers in water I use chicken broth. They fry so crispy and taste delish.Reply",
